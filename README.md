X Gate internship task
Hello and firsth I want thank you for the opportunity for this interview process. I have finished the task with some minor flaws. 
As this is a PHP internship and with my little knolewdge of PHP I tried to tackle this challenge with just PHP without using any frameworks. For explanation i am most comfortable in using Python/Java
and their frameworks Django/SpringBoot. Below is the explanation how to run this locally.
I was using XAMPP for the local host, when i would run it everything  and click on the folder public/ where it will take you to login/register page.
The database was written in SQLite. you can find it under database/mydatabse.db
